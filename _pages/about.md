My name is Athila Mattos, a specialized DevOps Engineer with about 15 years of experience working in the IT industry. Fortunate enough to have worked with a wide range of technologies around distributed systems, my journey started with managing on-premises platforms, mainly IBM System Storage and AIX, where everything began.

Over the years, I have modernized my skillset with the intent to remain relevant by sheer curiosity, which has always been my primary source of motivation, along with my interest in self-hosting, which has always brought me incredible opportunities to learn and get my hands on new things. This learning experience is what I want to share in this space.

Here, I want to write about the personal projects in my home lab that I consider interesting. I will share the details of these implementations via simple How-Tos and reference the relevant supporting materials for you to follow along, either in the form of code snippets, shell scripts, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests, or anything else that may be helpful if you are seeking the same or similar endeavors.

The technology stack I am currently using and that I cover in this blog is mostly Ansible, some Terraform, Docker containers, Kubernetes, and Linux in general either running on Intel-based systems or ARM. As an open-source enthusiast, I am happy to share my content, and hopefully, something will benefit you as well.
