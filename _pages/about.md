My name is Athila Mattos, I am a specialized DevOps Engineer with about 15 years of experience working in the IT industry. Fortunate enough to have worked with a wide range of technologies around distributed systems, my journey started with managing on-premises platforms, mainly IBM System Storage and AIX, where everything began.

Over the years, I have modernized my skillset with the intent to remain relevant by sheer curiosity, which has always been my primary source of motivation, along with my interest in self-hosting, which has always brought me incredible opportunities to learn and get my hands on new things, and that's what I want to share with you.

In this space, I want to write about my implementations and experiences in my home lab that I consider to be helpful if you are seeking the same or similar endeavors. My intention is to share simple snippets of code being a shell script, an Ansible playbook, a Kubernetes manifest, or anything that I either find interesting or that made my life easier in general.

As an open-source enthusiast, I am happy to share my content with you, and hopefully, something will benefit you as well.
